This is a Title
===============

The first line in this file is the title. Following whitespace characters (`\s`) and equal signs (`=`) are ignored.
The remainder of the file is considered the description.
The description will be stripped of any preceding or following whitespaces. Nevertheless a meta-file should end with an empty line.
The description contains the #hashtags, which help to categorize the content.
Hashtags are case-insensitive and may occur anywhere in the description.
The typical "meta"-information-hashtags may be added as a seperate paragraph at the end.
